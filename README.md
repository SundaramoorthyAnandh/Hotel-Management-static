Built a static website with HTML,CSS, Scrollreveal.js and Smoothscroll.js

Used grid system of Bootstrap v3 

**Scroll reveal** - `https://scrollrevealjs.org`

ScrollReveal is a JavaScript library for easily animating elements as they enter/leave the viewport. 
It was designed to be robust and flexible, but hopefully youâ€™ll be surprised below at how easy it is to pick up.

**Smooth scroll** - `www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp`

Smooth scroll allows to smoothly scroll to the sections of html page with elegant animation
